JSP (JavaServer Pages) and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) are both template engines used for dynamic web content generation,
but they have different syntax and are often associated with different server-side technologies. Here's a comparison of
their syntax differences:

1. **Delimiter/Tag Enclosure**:

    - **JSP**: JSP uses `<% %>` for Java code blocks and `<%= %>` for expressions. For example:

      ```jsp
      <% int num = 10; %>
      <%= "The number is: " + num %>
      ```

    - **EJS**: EJS uses `<% %>` for control flow (like loops and conditionals) and `<%= %>` for embedding JavaScript
      variables or expressions. For example:

      ```ejs
      <% let num = 10; %>
      <%= "The number is: " + num %>
      ```

2. **Variable Output**:

    - **JSP**: To output variables or expressions, you use `<%= %>`. For example, `<%= myVar %>`

    - **EJS**: To output variables or expressions, you also use `<%= %>`. For example, `<%= myVar %>`

3. **Control Flow**:

    - **JSP**: Control flow in JSP is often done using scriptlet tags `<% %>`. For example:

      ```jsp
      <% if (condition) { %>
        <!-- Code here -->
      <% } else { %>
        <!-- Code here -->
      <% } %>
      ```

    - **EJS**: Control flow in EJS also uses `<% %>`. For example:

      ```ejs
      <% if (condition) { %>
        <!-- Code here -->
      <% } else { %>
        <!-- Code here -->
      <% } %>
      ```

4. **Comments**:

    - **JSP**: JSP comments are written as `<%-- --%>`. For example:

      ```jsp
      <%-- This is a JSP comment --%>
      ```

    - **EJS**: EJS comments are written as `<%# %>`. For example:

      ```ejs
      <%# This is an EJS comment %>
      ```

5. **Iteration**:

    - **JSP**: JSP uses scriptlets for loops. For example:

      ```jsp
      <% for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { %>
        <!-- Loop body -->
      <% } %>
      ```

    - **EJS**: EJS also uses scriptlets for loops. For example:

      ```ejs
      <% for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { %>
        <!-- Loop body -->
      <% } %>
      ```

6. **Escaping Output**:

    - **JSP**: In JSP, you need to manually escape HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

    - **EJS**: EJS automatically escapes output by default but provides an option to unescape with `<%- %>`. For
      example:

      ```ejs
      <%- unescapedHTML %>
      ```

7. **Language**:

    - **JSP**: JSP primarily uses Java for server-side logic.

    - **EJS**: EJS primarily uses JavaScript for server-side logic.

8. **Integration**:

    - **JSP**: JSP is typically used with Java-based web frameworks like JavaServer Faces (JSF) and Servlets.

    - **EJS**: EJS is commonly used with JavaScript-based web frameworks like Express.js for Node.js.

In summary, while JSP and EJS serve a similar purpose for dynamic web content generation, they have different syntax and
are often associated with different server-side technologies and programming languages (Java for JSP and JavaScript for
EJS). Your choice between them may depend on your preferred programming language and the web framework or environment
you are working with.
