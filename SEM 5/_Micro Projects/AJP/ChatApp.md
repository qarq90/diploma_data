Building a chat application using Java, Servlets, JSP, and MySQL is a comprehensive project, and I can provide you with
a high-level overview of the steps involved. This project will require a good understanding of Java, web development,
and database management. Here's a roadmap to get you started:

1. **Project Setup:**
    - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and set up your development environment.
    - Install a web server like Apache Tomcat.
    - Set up a MySQL database and make sure you have the necessary JDBC driver.

2. **Database Design:**
    - Design your database schema. You'll need tables for users, messages, groups, etc. Here's a simplified example:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE messages (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       sender_id INT,
       receiver_id INT,
       message TEXT,
       timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES users(id),
       FOREIGN KEY (receiver_id) REFERENCES users(id)
   );

   -- You can have similar tables for groups and group messages
   ```

3. **User Authentication:**
    - Implement user registration and login functionality.
    - Use Servlets and JSP for user registration and login forms.
    - Hash and salt passwords before storing them in the database.

4. **User Interface:**
    - Create a user-friendly web interface using JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Implement user profiles and friend requests features.
    - Allow users to update their profiles.

5. **Chat Functionality:**
    - Implement real-time chat functionality.
    - Use WebSocket or AJAX to enable real-time messaging.
    - Store and retrieve messages from the database.

6. **Group Chat:**
    - Implement group chat functionality.
    - Create tables to manage groups and group memberships.
    - Allow users to create, join, and leave groups.

7. **Security:**
    - Implement security measures to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities.
    - Secure user authentication and session management.

8. **Validation and Error Handling:**
    - Implement validation for user input to ensure data integrity.
    - Provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptions gracefully.

9. **Testing:**
    - Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix bugs.
    - Test it with different browsers and devices.

10. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your application on a web server (e.g., Tomcat).
    - Make sure your database is accessible from the deployed server.

11. **Documentation:**
    - Document your code, including comments and user guides.

12. **Maintenance and Scaling:**
    - Monitor and maintain your application.
    - Consider scalability options as your user base grows.

13. **Optional Features:**
    - Consider adding additional features like multimedia file sharing, notifications, etc., as per your project
      requirements.

This project is quite complex, so it's essential to break it down into smaller tasks and work on them incrementally.
Additionally, you may want to use Java frameworks like Spring or libraries like WebSocket for certain parts of the
project to streamline development. Finally, ensure that you follow best practices for security and performance
throughout the development process.
